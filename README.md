wetube
======

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/k8si/wetube.git && cd wetube`
2. Set the WETUBE_ROOT environment variable: `export WETUBE_ROOT=$PWD`
3. Set your GOPATH: `export GOPATH=$PWD/peer`
4. Build all of the things: `./build.sh [your-email] [your-computers-hostname]` (the arguments to `build.sh` are used to generate RSA keys -- the script will ask you for a password, which you should leave blank for security reasons i.e. I am *not* secure about whether or not anything will work if you provide a password)
5. Start all of the things: `./start.sh [your-public-ip-address]`
6. Open a browser window to `http://localhost:8080` and start tubin'. It might be more fun if you repeat steps 1-5 process on a bunch of internet-connected computers that are on different subnets.

`start.sh` will start the GUI, the http server, and the Wetube client as background processes (it prints the PID for each). If you for some reason should want to stop any of these components, you'll have to `kill [pid]`. 

After you're done with everything, or if you want to start over, you can run `./clean.sh` to clean up all the files generated by `build.sh`.
